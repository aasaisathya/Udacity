## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset to better understand:

Question 1: Which Nation has most number of Soccer Players collected in FIFA 18, list the top 20 Nations

Question 2: How about the age distribution of the FIFA 18 Players?

Question 3: Find out the top 10 clubs with highest total player market value, and the highest average player wage

Question 4: Choose the best squad

Question 5: Correlation between Age, Overall, Potential, Position, Club, Nationality, Special vs Value/Wage


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

PlayerAttributeData.csv       - This file contains Player performance attributes (Overall, Potential, Aggression, Agility etc.) indexed by player id.

PlayerPersonalData.csv        - This file contains basic Player personal attributes (Nationality, Club, Photo, Age, Wage, Value etc.)

PlayerPlayingPositionData.csv - This file contains Player preferred position and ratings at all positions.

CompleteDataset.csv           - This file is the complete dataset contains all informaiton in above three dataset.
