## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset to better understand:

1. Which Country has the maximum number of Soccer Players collected in FIFA 18 and List the top 20 countries?

2. What is the age distribution of the FIFA 18 Players?

3. Identify the top 10 clubs with the highest total player market value, and the highest average player wage?

4. Identify the best Squad?

5. Do Correlation between Age, Overall, Potential, Position, Club, Nationality, Special vs Value/Wage



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

PlayerAttributeData.csv       - This file contains Player performance attributes (Overall, Potential, Aggression, Agility etc.) indexed by player id.

PlayerPersonalData.csv        - This file contains basic Player personal attributes (Nationality, Club, Photo, Age, Wage, Value etc.)

PlayerPlayingPositionData.csv - This file contains Player preferred position and ratings at all positions.

CompleteDataset.csv           - This file is the complete dataset contains all informaiton in above three dataset.
